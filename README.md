**House Price Predictor**

This project predicts California house prices using real-world features like income, room count, and proximity to ocean. Designed to explore how machine learning can support pricing insights for consumers, analysts, and real estate platforms.

**Why This Project?**
Pricing a home is rarely straightforward. I built this project to understand how multiple property features interact in determining house valueâ€”and how predictive models can bring transparency to that process.

**This notebook helps:**

Home buyers or sellers estimate fair value

Data professionals practice regression modeling

Real estate teams test ML-driven insights, without building a full pipeline

**What It Does**
Predicts house prices using Random Forest and Linear Regression

Shows which features impact pricing most

Lets users interactively test scenarios via sliders

Runs entirely in Google Colab with no upload or API required

**Tools & Tech**
Python, pandas, numpy

Scikit-learn for modeling

Seaborn, matplotlib for visuals

Ipywidgets for interactivity

Public California housing dataset

**Business Relevance**
This project is a proof-of-concept for how fast, explainable ML tools can empower early-stage pricing, customer education, or sales workflows in real estate.
